Xsection is a command line(ish) Python-written program for data extration from Digital Elevation Models. It's main function is creation and preparation of cross-sectional and longitudinal river profiles for their use in 1D hydraulic modelling. Program is heavily inspired by [DHI](https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/products/mike-11)'s proprietary plugin, called Mike 11 GIS, and it's [HEC-RAS](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/)'s alternative QGIS plugin, called [RIVER GIS]
